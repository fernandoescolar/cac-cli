This name comes from: **C**onfiguration **a**s **C**ode.

Configuration as code (CAC) is managing configuration resources in your source repository. You treat your application config resources as versioned artifacts. By managing your application environment in tandem with your application code, you gain the same benefits you get with your code. CAC is a set of processes and practices that will save you time, increase your flexibility, and improve your system uptime.

- Simplify Configuration Data
- Take Advantage of Version Control
- IAC and CAC both together

**cac-cli** will help you appling CAC.
